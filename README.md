# M2_Water-Level-Controller
Water Level Controller using 8051 Microcontroller project will help in automatically controlling the water motor by sensing the water level in a tank.The Motor is turned OFF when the top tank or tanky is full. Here the water level of the tank is shown on the LCD screen. With this system, we can also avoid overflowing the water. Here we are designing the circuit which is used to detect and control the water level automatically in the overhead tank using 8051 Microcontroller.
